# Parallel Programming Assignments

A collection of programming assignments and examples from **"An Introduction to Parallel Programming"** by Peter Pacheco and Matthew Malensek.

This repository serves as a personal learning log and a practical reference for key parallel programming concepts implemented using different APIs.

## 📚 About the Book
This repository accompanies my study of the textbook [*An Introduction to Parallel Programming*](https://www.elsevier.com/books/an-introduction-to-parallel-programming/pacheco/978-0-12-804605-0) (2nd Edition, 2021). The code implements and expands upon exercises and concepts presented throughout the book.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Building
General requirements for building code in this repository:
- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`, `nvcc` for CUDA)
- Corresponding parallel libraries installed (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA Toolkit, etc.)
